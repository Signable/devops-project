# devops-project

This project is designed to get you thinking about security and scalability.

It's a barebones _helloworld_ api, with an NGINX container running to respond on port 80. It's not intended to be
a feature complete API.
We'd like you to take this theoretical application, and make it secure and scalable!

**You do not need to provision this infrastructure**, but are looking to understand your design, code and structure decisions
rather than see a 100% polished project. However, this is up to you!

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Make your changes to ensure that the _helloworld_ api is:
   3. Secure
   4. Scalable
